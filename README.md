## ðŸ’– Support Me
Hi! Iâ€™m krazyjakee ðŸŽ®, creator and maintainÂ­er of the *NodotProject* - a suite of openâ€‘source Godot tools (e.g. Nodot, Gedis etc) that empower game developers to build faster and maintain cleaner code.

Iâ€™m looking for sponsors to help sustain and grow the project: more dev time, better docs, more features, and deeper community support. Your support means more stable, polished tools used by indie makers and studios alike.
